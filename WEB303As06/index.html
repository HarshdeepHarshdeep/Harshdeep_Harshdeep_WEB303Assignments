The group are composed of Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and previously Zayn Malik until his departure from the group in March 2015. The group signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010.

                        Propelled to global success by social media,[1][2][3] One Direction's five albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015), topped charts in several countries, and generated hit singles including "What Makes You Beautiful" (their first number one on the UK Singles Chart, and the highest debut for a British act on the US Billboard Hot 100 since 1998), "Live While We're Young", "Best Song Ever", "Story of My Life" and "Drag Me Down". After the release of Four, One Direction became the first band in the US Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums debut at number one.[4] Their third album, Midnight Memories, was the best-selling album worldwide of 2013.</p>

                    <p>One Direction Laurie Blue Adkins was born in North London, England, on May 5, 1988. One Direction was the sole child of Penny Adkins, a "artsy mom" who was just 18 when she gave birth, and Mark Evans, a Welsh father who abandoned the family when One Direction was only four years old.

                        Evans kept in touch with his daughter until she was in her adolescent years, when his alcoholism and growing isolation from her led their connection to deteriorate. One Direction, on the other hand, had a strong relationship with her mother, who encouraged her young daughter to "explore rather than stay with one thing."</p>

                    <p>Released in September 2011 in the UK and Ireland, One Direction's debut single, "What Makes You Beautiful", was a commercial and international success. It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart after becoming the most pre-ordered Sony Music Entertainment single in history.[38][39] Subsequent singles, "Gotta Be You" and "One Thing", peaked in the UK Singles Chart top ten.[40][41] In November 2011, they signed a record deal with Columbia Records in North America.[42] Steve Barnett, the co-chairman of Columbia Records, said it was not a difficult decision to sign One Direction; "I just thought there was a void, and maybe they could seize and hold it."[43] That same month, they released Up All Night, their debut studio album, in the UK and Ireland. Critically commended for its appeal to the teenage audience,[44][45][46] it became the UK's fastest-selling debut album of 2011.[47] In December 2011, they embarked on their first headlining UK concert tour, the Up All Night Tour</p>

It debuted at number one in the UK and in the US, making them the first group to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 with its first three albums, and the second to reach the top after The Monkees in 1967.[119] The album has since been recognized as a turning point in the musical style of the band, with sites quoting it as having a "significant shift in sound" in addition to the solos in songs being more evenly spread out in contrast to their previous two albums. 15 of the album's 18 songs were written by members in the band (Tomlinson being the leader with 12 writing credits) compared to only four songs being written by the group on Take Me Home and three on Up All Night.[120] The album was described by the band as edgier and as having a "slightly rockier tone" than their previous efforts.[121] Despite being released at the year's end, it was the best-selling album worldwide in 2013 with 4 million copies sold globally.[122] To promote the album, the band performed on both the American and British versions of The X Factor</p>
